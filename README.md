 I want to improve my knowledge about Data Structures. In this project It will help me to to this. I am using matter.js library.

First thing I try is understanding the Matter.js library. To do so, I create a box, and understand using gravity and isSticky property. It helped me to create border for my maze. When I did not give isSticky property to my box, the box was dissappearing. Now however, I insert four more rectangles to create borders, and give them 'isSticky: true' property.![Screenshot_280](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51987890/193448815-e2a9bb57-19ba-46d3-9b05-5d857bcd7df8.png)
